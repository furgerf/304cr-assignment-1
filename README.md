# 304cr-assignment-1

## Synopsis
This project contains my solution to the first assignment in the module 304cr "Games and AI" at Coventry University 2014/15. The core challenge is to implement pathfinding with with the A\*-algorithm. Maps that form the world for the pathfinding can be
extensively edited, saved and loaded. Furthermore, apart from normal, __clear__ tiles, there is also the possibility of declaring tiles as __foggy__ which means that these tiles can't be part of the (stationary) pathfinding but have to be explored.
